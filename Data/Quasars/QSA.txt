- corona and interplay not necessarily known ..

- dust extinction 

	All these are going to vary the intrinsic redshift and so the fluxes themselves ..

- He said 4 sigma but it is really not so ?

- Extrapolation of the UV luminosity to high redshift.

- reddening is corrected by taking different color/band at different redshift. This is not the best but the only available solution. 

- Looking only for the brightest objects is the way the bias is reduced as much as possible. 


- Since a number of approximations are involved there could be possible way to have a simultaneous analysis of systematics and statistics. Can it be done ?
